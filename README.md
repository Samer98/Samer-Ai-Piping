   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 3000:3000 fast-api-app
   ```

This will start the Ai-Piping application in a Docker container, and you can access it by opening a web browser and navigating to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:8000).

## Usage ðŸš€

Once the Ai-Piping application is running, you can leverage OpenAI's capabilities for various tasks. To get recommendations based on the country you're willing to travel to and the season, you can use the following API endpoint:

This API for recommendations page
```
http://127.0.0.1:3000/recommendations_page
```

This API for query params
```
http://127.0.0.1:3000//api/recommendations
```
send in query params $country ,  $season
the result will be similar to this
```
{
    "country": "egypt",
    "season": "winter",
    "recommendations": [
        "1. Visit the Pyramids of Giza: Explore one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World in a less crowded season. Enjoy the stunning views of the pyramids covered in a picturesque snowfall, and take advantage of the cooler temperatures for a more comfortable visit.",
