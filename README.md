   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 3000:3000 fast-api-app
   ```

This will start the Ai-Piping application in a Docker container, and you can access it by opening a web browser and navigating to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:8000).

## Usage ðŸš€

Once the Ai-Piping application is running, you can leverage OpenAI's capabilities for various tasks. To get recommendations based on the country you're willing to travel to and the season, you can use the following API endpoint:

This API for recommendations page
```
http://127.0.0.1:3000/recommendations_page
```

This API for query params direct
```
http://127.0.0.1:3000/recommendations?country=$country&season=$season
```

Be sure to write valid name for country and season or you might get errors

To check what is the available country/city use this API

```
http://127.0.0.1:3000/country_cities
```

To check what is the available seasons use this API

```
http://127.0.0.1:3000/seasons
```
